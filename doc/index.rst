   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to the PyADi documentation!
===================================

PyADi performs first order automatic differentiation (AD) via source
transformation for any regular Python function `f`. It is easy to use
as there is just one function for the user to call,
:py:func:`.DiffFor`. Read our documentation on installation and basic
usage for a quick start.
